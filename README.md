# 🎥 Multi-Agent AI System for Multimedia Content Analysis

## Overview
This project is a multi-agent AI system that automatically analyzes video and audio content. It uses specialized AI agents to transcribe media, summarize content, explain complex concepts, perform contextual web searches, and generate reflective questions for learning.

The system improves clarity, accuracy, and user engagement by distributing tasks across multiple agents instead of relying on a single monolithic model.

## System Architecture
The system is composed of multiple specialized agents coordinated by a central planner:

- **Planner Agent** – Orchestrates tasks, downloads media, and triggers transcription  
- **Summarizer Agent** – Produces concise summaries  
- **Explainer Agent** – Explains complex concepts and retrieves external context  
- **Question Generator Agent** – Generates comprehension and reflection questions
